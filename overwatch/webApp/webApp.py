""" Web App for serving Overwatch results, as well as access to user defined reprocessing
and times slices.

This is the main web app executable, so it contains quite some functionality, especially
that which is not so obvious how to refactor when using flask. Routing is divided up
into authenticated and unauthenticated views.
