class User(UserMixin):
    """ A basic user class to manage authentication.

    Inherits from ``UserMixin``, which implements a basic class for use with ``login_manger()``.

    New users should be added into the external config file. This class provides no ability to store new users dynamically
    and assumes that passwords passed to it are already hashed by ``bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password, BCRYPT_LOG_ROUNDS)``.

    The ``login_manager`` stores this class to manage users.

    Note:
        There are also a few attributes inherited from UserMixin

    Args:
        username (str): Username of new user
        password (str): Hashed password of new user. Password should be hashed with
            ``bcrypt.generate_password_hash(desiredPassword, BCRYPT_LOG_ROUNDS)``

    Attributes:
        users (dict): Contains all valid users with hashed passwords. Loaded from an extra config file.
        id (str): The username of the instance of the object
        password (str): The password of the instance of the object. Note: This must be hashed by the user before
            passing to this object!
