    """ Filter to bundle Polymer html imports into a single file for deployment.

    Best practices dictate that the Polymer html imports should be combined into a single file
    to reduce the number of individual http requests. Polymer provides a tool to do so, called
    ``polymer-bundler``. By taking advantage of ``webassets``, we can automatically combine and
    minimize these files when starting a web app deployment.

    To successfully define the filter, the following details must be addressed:

    - polymer-bundler must only be executed with relative paths, so we cannot use
      ``ExternalTool.subprocess``, since that gives absolute paths.
    - To ensure that the polymer components also work when not bundled, the filter must be
      executed in a directory above the static dir.

    These issues causes quite some complications! See the ``input(...)`` function for how to deal
    with these issues.

    When ``webassets`` is run in debug mode, this filter will not be run! Instead, the standard
    (un-minified) version will be included. For information on forcing this filter to be run,
    see the :doc:`web app README </webAppReadme>`.

            ``polymer-bundler`` parses arguments a bit strangely - values such as paths still need
            to be in a separate argument. Thus, the arguments looks more split than would usually
            be expected.

            _in (StringIO): Input for the filter. Not used here.
            out (StringIO): Output for the filter. The output for ``polymer-bundler`` is written here.
