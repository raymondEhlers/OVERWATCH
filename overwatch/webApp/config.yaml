##    The folder structure for flask can get complicated. See the variables below for their
##    purposes. One can generally set staticFolder without staticURLPath, but not the reverse.

#: Setup Bcrypt.
bcryptLogRounds: &bcryptLogRounds 12

#: Default user name. An empty string will disable it.
#: Should only be used when behind CERN SSO!

#: basePath is just a useful value.
#: It defines a base directory to reference if the static, template, etc folders are
#: all in the same dir.
basePath: ""

#: staticFolder is the disk location of the static folder.
#: It is a flask defined variable.
#: To check if the static files are from the front-end webserver, use:
#: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16595691/static-files-with-flask-in-production
#:
#: (ie. add + "CHANGE" to the staticFolder location specified here).
#staticFolder = os.path.join(sharedParameters.staticFolderName) 
staticFolder: *staticFolder

#: staticURLPath is the URL of the static folder.
#: If you want to access "foo", it would be at $BASE_URL/staticURLPath/foo. "" is just the root.
#: It is a flask defined variable.
staticURLPath: "/static"

docsBuildFolder: !joinPaths
    - *docsFolder

#: Each user sure should added of the form user: "password"
#: If the password is not hashed, then the _users type should be
#: "!bcrypt". It will then hash all passwords that are passed
#: Also be certain to pass bcryptLogRounds for it to succeed
_users: !bcrypt
