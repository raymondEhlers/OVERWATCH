""" Handles configuration of overwatch via yaml.

Configurations are built in a hierarchy, with the base configuration providing
the first layer, and building up further until the specified module.

YAML parsing plugins are also specified here. This breaks the abstraction
a little bit, but it makes things much simpler, so it's worth the trade-off.
