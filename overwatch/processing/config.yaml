#: Force each run to be re-merged.
#: Note that this can change the merging if new information has arrived since the last merge.

#: Transfer data to the remote system.
sendData: False

#: Set the type of merging based on the data we are receiving. If set to true, that means we are receiving
#: cumulative files (i.e. the hists are not reset after they are sent by the HLT). In that case,
#: to do a partial merge we take the last run file and subtract it from the first. 
cumulativeMode: True

#: Specifies the prefix necessary to get to all of the folders.
#: Don't include a trailing slash! (This may be mitigated by os.path calls, but not worth the
#: risk in changing it).
