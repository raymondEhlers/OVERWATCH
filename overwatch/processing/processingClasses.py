    It stores run level information, as well the subsystems which then containing the corresponding
    event information (histogram groups, histograms, etc).

    Note that files are *not* considered event level information because the files correspond to individual
    subsystem. Furthermore, in rare cases, there may be numbers of files for different subsystems
    that are included in an individual run. Consequently, it is cleaner for each subsystem to track it's
    own files.

    To allow the object to be reconstructed from scratch, the HLT mode is stored by writing a YAML file
    in the corresponding run directory. This file is referred to as the "run info" file. Additional
    properties could also be written to this file to avoid the loss of transient information.

    Note:
        The run info file is read and written on object construction. It will only be checked if the

            formatted as ``Run123456``
        startOfRun (int): Start of the run in unix time.

            Default: ``False``.
        fileLocationSubsystem (str): Subsystem name of where the files are actually located. If a subsystem
            has specific data files then this is just equal to the `subsystem`. However, if it relies on
            files inside of another subsystem (such as those from the HLT subsystem receiver), then this
            variable is equal to that subsystem name. Default: ``None``, which corresponds to the subsystem
            storing it's own data.

    Attributes:
        subsystem (str): The current subsystem in the form of a three letter, all capital name (ex. ``EMC``).
        showRootFiles (bool): True if the ROOT files should be made accessible through the run list.
        fileLocationSubsystem (str): Subsystem name of where the files are actually located. If a subsystem has
            specific data files then this is just equal to the `subsystem`. However, if it relies on files inside
            of another subsystem, then this variable is equal to that subsystem name.
        files (BTree): Dict-like object which describes subsystem ROOT files. Unix time of a given file is the key
            and a file container for that file is the value.
        timeSlices (BTree): Dict-like object which describes subsystem time slices. A UUID is the dict key (so they
            can be uniquely identified), while a timeSliceContainer with the corresponding time slice properties
            is the value.
        combinedFile (fileContainer): File container corresponding to the combined file.
        baseDir (str): Path to the base storage directory for the subsystem. Of the form ``Run123456/SYS``.
        imgDir (str): Path to the image storage directory for the subsystem. Of the form ``Run123456/SYS/img``.
        jsonDir (str): Path to the json storage directory for the subsystem. Of the form ``Run123456/SYS/json``.
        startOfRun (int): Start of the run in unix time.
        endOfRun (int): End of the run in unix time.
        runLength (int): Length of the run in minutes.
        histGroups (PersistentList): List-like object of histogram groups, which are used to classify similar histograms.
        histsInFile (BTree): Dict-like object of all histograms that are in a particular file. Keys are the histogram name,
            while the values are ``histogramContainer`` objects which contain the histogram. Hists should be usually be accessed
            through the hist groups, but list this provides direct access when necessary early in processing.
        histsAvailable (BTree): Dict-like object containing all histograms that are available, including those in a particular
            file and those that are created during processing. Newly created hists should be stored in this dict. Keys are
            histogram names, while values are ``histogramContainer`` objects which contain the histogram.
        hists (BTree): Dict-like object which contains all histograms that should be processed by a histogram.
            After initial creation, this should be the definitive source of histograms for processing and display.
            Keys are histogram names, while values are ``histogramContainer`` objects which contain the histogram.
        newFile (bool): True if we received a new file, while will trigger reprocessing. This flag should only be
            changed when beginning processing the next time. To be explicit, if a subsystem just received a new file
            and it was processed, this flag should only be changed to ``False`` after the next processing iteration
            begins. This allows the status of the run (determined through the subsystem) to be displayed in the web app.
            Default: True because if the subsystem is being created, we likely need reprocessing.
        nEvents (int): Number of events in the subsystem. Processing will look for a histogram that contains ``events``
            in the name and attempt to extract the number of events based on the number of entries. Should not be used
            unless the subsystem explicitly includes a histogram with the number of events. Default: 1.
        processingOptions (PersistentMapping): Implemented by the subsystem to note options used during
            standard processing. The subsystem processing options can vary when processing a time slice,
            so storing the options allow us to return to the standard options when performing a full processing.
            Keys are the option names as string, while values are their corresponding values.
